# Assignment 2 Reflection - David Janney

## Approach to the Problem

I started off by trying to understand all of the code to the point where I lost track of the important stuff. I decided to take a step back (and put this off for way too long) before deciding to click on every resource available in brightspace and read them carefully. I used the Random Permutations Notes to guide me to accomplish the goals without having to decypher the very simplified (both its best and worst quality) instructions in the book. I also used [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/cpp-recursion/) to guide myself on formatting and syntax. For the coding itself, I used the Random Permutations Notes as a guideline while coding the project. Algorithm 2 was very easy this was, as it was basically Algorithm 1 but with a few minor changes. That's also where I renamed "rand_num1" to "ran".

## Techniques Used

* using the "static size_t search" as a template for the permutations
* using a different compiler to implement and test changes without accidentally erasing GitHub progress (my most common mistake)
  * [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)
* using Algorithm 1 as a template for Algorithm 2

## Challenges Encountered

* not knowing where or how to start
  * rereading the textbook
  * checking the Random Permutations Notes (I forgot about that)
* using a different compiler because the GitHub one stopped working
   * [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) (again)
   * reading the GitHub console once I figured out I could do that (you should have an email from me related to that)
* swapping arrays
   * attempted using [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/quickly-swap-two-arrays-size-c/), used a different method I learned from an onlice C++ tutorial I watched a long time ago instead

## Conclusions

In conclusion, algorithms can be done many ways. I learned that the larger an algorithm, the harder it is to randomly stumble across a new variable, and that searching a single spot in a bool array is much quicker than searching an entire array, spot by spot.
