# Assignment 2 Analysis - David Janney

## Algorithm 1

Big-Oh - $O(N^2)$ (may have to run through all possibilities at some points, checks everyhing)

5000 - 0.15s

10000 - 0.64s

20000 - 2.61s

40000 - 8.68s

## Algorithm 2

Big-Oh - $O(N)$ or $O(N^2)$ (may have to run through all possibilities at some points, checks only one value)

100000 - 0.02s

200000 - 0.03s

400000 - 0.10s

800000 - 0.14s

1600000 - 0.34s

3200000 - 0.92s

6400000 - 1.68s

## Algorithm 3

Big-Oh - $O(N)$ (simple swap, can't fail)

500000 - 0.01s

1000000 - 0.02s

2000000 - 0.03s

4000000 - 0.07s

8000000 - 0.32s

16000000 - 0.94s

32000000 - 2.40s
